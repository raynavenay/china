		First off you could find a good VPN. Now be carefully with these as China could block the 
		VPN as soon as they find out, so find many good VPNS. A VPN is a secure, personal portal 
		to the Internet.VPN routers can be bought for your home. You could also find a good VPN 
		plus pocket wifi. Pocket wifi is a mobile wifi router or hotspot. Another thing to do is 
		get a sims card plus a VPN. The phone has to be unlocked for the sim card to work. Almost 
		every solution is going to involve having a VPN. The only solution without a VPN would be 
		to have T-mobile but that would require signing up in another country. The data T-mobile 
		has is only a  little spotty in places like China. For the most part it will work freely.
